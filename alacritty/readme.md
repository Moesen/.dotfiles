## **fonts.yml example**
```
font:
  normal:
    family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"

  bold:
    family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"
    style: "Bold"

  italic: 
    family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"
    style: "Italic"
    

  bold_italic:
    family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font"
    style: "Bold Italic"

  size: 14.5
```

### **Reminder**
The fonts file is not included, as it is individual between screen sizes what looks nice, and I don't know a good way to make it generic
