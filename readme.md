# Personal Dotfiles
Repo for my personal dotfiles. To setup clone the repo, and run the `setup.bat` to configure symlinks


# Do this to add snippets 
*obs. this is not in makefile, as coc and ultisnips must already be installed, otherwise .config/coc folder will not exist*
`ln -sfn ~/.dotfiles/ultisnips ~/.config/coc`

# Nice links
